# Data Lake Design

## Project Overview
Medical Data Processing Company, based out of San Francisco, specializes in processing various types of EMR (Electronic Medical Records) and provides real-time insights to various medical facilities. These data insights are used by their customers to stay compliant with laws, track patient health metrics, admit discharge records, and bed availability. This service is used by about 8000 individual medical care facilities, including Urgent Care (UC), hospitals, nursing homes, emergency rooms, and critical care units.

The company has experienced hyper growth over the past 3 years. However, as the volume of data continues to grow, the existing infrastructure has not been able to scale. The company has made every type of optimization, configuration changes, and hardware updates, but it has not helped significantly in terms of performance and scale.

Last week, there was a surge in data, during the nightly ETL process, the database server crashed and the whole system was offline for several hours. The CTO wants to evaluate if building a Data Lake makes sense to solve the companyâ€™s challenges. The goal of this project is to provide a detailed Data Lake design and rationale behind the design decisions.
